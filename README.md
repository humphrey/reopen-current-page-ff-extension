# Reopen current page Firefox Extension

Often I need to reopen a tab, but not reload all the resources.  This extension adds a "go" button to the Firefox Toolbar that does this.  Now that I've made this, I'm not 100% convince it is actually being more efficient than the FF reload button.  I'll see how I go as I use it.
